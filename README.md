# Transformer-Models-from-Scratch
This repository contains various tranformer models that I implemented from scratch, including:
1. encoder-only transformer model for text classification:
    - [Encoder_only_transformer_AG_News.ipynb](https://github.com/hbchen2021/Transformer-Models-from-Scratch/blob/main/Encoder_only_transformer_AG_News.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/hbchen2021/Transformer-Models-from-Scratch/blob/main/Encoder_only_transformer_AG_News.ipynb)
    - 
2. decoder-only transformer model (GPT-like) for doing addition 
    - [GPT_Addition.ipynb](https://github.com/hbchen2021/Transformer-Models-from-Scratch/blob/main/GPT_Addition.ipynb)  
5. and more to be added...

[Transformer_details.pdf](https://github.com/hbchen2021/Transformer-Models-from-Scratch/blob/main/Transformer_details.pdf) contains some details of the transformer model that I
found a little bit confusing when I first tried to implement it from
scratch.
